This directory contains the scripts that we used to run the Perses tool
and compare it with TypeSlice. There are three directories; two correspond
to bugs from the evaluation (and contain the scripts to run Perses on
those bugs), while the third contains the scripts for running TypeSlice
_and then_ Perses.

This directory also contains screenshots to substantiate our claims
about Perses' run time on our server, as well as the file
`differences-between-TypeSlice-and-perses.md`, which shows the
outputs from each tool for each bug, and analyzes the differences
between them. If you just want to see our analysis, this file
is the most useful.
